AI-ChatBot in Android Application 

*Simsimi API< <http://developer.simsimi.com/> >has been used for the implementation of the ChatBot.*

The code is fully functional. For the users they have to go **app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml** after opening the project on Android Studio and paste the generated API key after being signed in on the prementioned link.

Just for Learning n Testing :P
